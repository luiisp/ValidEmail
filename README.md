Add a url to video file in your ReadMe.
Github now supports videos, see more detailed answer here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/4279746/1092815

You can see a live example here (See at the end of the readme):
https://github.com/alelievr/Mixture/blob/0.4.0/README.md

Github Pages
I strongly recommend placing the video in a project website created with GitHub Pages instead of the readme, like described in VonC's answer; it will be a lot better than any of these ideas. But if you need a quick fix just like I needed, here are some suggestions.

Use a gif
See aloisdg's answer, result is awesome, gifs are rendered on github's readme ;)

Use a video player picture
You could trick the user into thinking the video is on the readme page with a picture. It sounds like an ad trick, it's not perfect, but it works and it's funny ;).

Example:

[![Nome do VÃ­deo](http://img.youtube.com/vi/4rgPSj4eERQ/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rgPSj4eERQ)
